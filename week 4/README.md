In Module Four, you'll explore the evolution of networks over time, 
including the different models that generate networks with realistic features, 
such as the Preferential Attachment Model and Small World Networks. You will 
also explore the link prediction problem, where you will learn useful features 
that can predict whether a pair of disconnected nodes will be connected in the 
future. In the assignment, you will be challenged to identify which model generated 
a given network. Additionally, you will have the opportunity to combine different 
concepts of the course by predicting the salary, position, and future connections 
of the employees of a company using their logs of email exchanges.
